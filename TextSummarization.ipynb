Isliye, main ek sadasya theek hai, is karyakram mein bhi apna samay dena theek lagta hai. Isliye, aaj main aapke saath aaya hoon keval ek sadasya ke roop mein aur aapke \\'sevak\\' ke roop mein, jaise aapke saath. \\n\\nHamare desh mein, sarkar aati gayi, bahut se yojana banayi gayi, charcha hui, aur bade bade lakshya nirdharit kiye gaye. Lekin meri anubhav aur darshan se, meri aankh mein aaya ki sarkar ke plans ke liye sabse mahatvapurn cheez yeh hai ki yeh plans ke labh uthne wale logon tak pahunchen aur koi kathinai nahin ho. Agar \\'Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana\\' (Pradhan Mantri Ghar Yojana) hai, to jhuggi aur slum mein rahe logon ko ghar mile. Unhe koi bhi office ke chakkar karna nahin chahiye.

Isliye, main phir se desh ke chare chalegi, taki logon ko sarkar ke yojanaon ke baare mein sun sakoon aur yeh janne ki koshish karein ki ve in yojanaon ka kya labh uth rahe hain, aur yeh janne ki koshish karein ki in yojanaon ne inke liye jise vah labh uthana tha, unke paas pahunchi hui hai ya nahin. \\n\\nIs \\'Viksit Bharat Sankalp Yatra\\' ko, is tarah se, meri apni pariksha hai.

Main hali mein kuch logon se mila tha jinhone Ayushman card ka upyog karke bimaariyon ke liye upchaar liya tha. Ek vyakti se ek kathor dard se bach gaya tha, aur Ayushman card ka upyog karke, unhone upchaar karvaya aur ab woh theek ho rahe hain. Maine unse poocha, aur unhone kaha: \"Mujhe yeh upchaar kaise mil raha tha? Ab Ayushman card ke karan maine dhairya rakha aur upchaar karvaya. Ab main theek ho raha hoon.\" \\n\\nAise kath kath hain, jo mujhe prasann karte hain. \\n\\nKaryavaahakon ne bhi yeh dekha hai ki in yojanaon ka labh uthane wale logon ko in yojanaon ke labh uthne ke liye koi kathinai nahin ho rahi hai. In yojanaon ka lakshya hai ki 50 ya 100 logon ko paise mil jayein. Iske liye unhone kaam kiya hai aur paise allocate kiye hain. Lekin unki kaam kiya hai, jab ve dekhte hain ki unke kaam ne kisi vyakti ki zindagi mein sudhara hai. Jab ve dekhte hain ki unke kaam ne kisi vyakti ki aarthik sthiti mein sudhara hai, to unki khushi hui. Isse unka utsah badhta hai. Unhe lagta hai ki ve accha kaam kiya hai. Unhe lagta hai ki ve apne kaam mein safalta hui hai. \\n\\nIs \\'Viksit Bharat Sankalp Yatra\\' ne karyavaahakon ko apne kaam mein safalta ki bhavana di hai. Unhe lagta hai ki ve kuch achha kiya hai. Unhe lagta hai ki ve apne kaam mein safalta hui hai. \\n\\nUnhe lagta hai ki ve kya ne kuch achha kiya hai, ismein yeh sabit hota hai ki maine jo bhi kaam kiya hai, maine kya sahi kiya hai, aur yeh sunna hai ki maine kya galat kiya hai. \\n\\nMaine kuch logon se suna hai jinhone Jeevan Jyoti Yojana ke liye paise milne se apni jeevan mein sudhara hai. Unhone kaha hai ki unhe 2 lakh rupaye milne se unki jeevan mein sudhara hai. Unhone kaha hai ki unhe gas geyser milne se unki jeevan mein sudhara hai.

The same feelings are  echoed by over \\nfifteen lakh youth, whom I have met so far and who represent the drea m of the 540 \\nmillion youth of the nation. The aspirations of the young to live in a prosperous, safe and \\nproud India should be the guiding factor in whatever profession we contribute. \\n \\nEmpower Villages \\nFriends, I recall my visit to Nagaland on 26th October 2002, soon after m y assuming \\noffice as President. It was a unique experience for me at Khuza ma village to meet tribal \\nvillage council members and discuss with them the village progress  and the dream of \\nvillage citizens. I was very happy to see the empowered village  council functioning with \\nfinancial powers and taking decisions. I saw a prosperous village with fruits and \\nvegetables production. However, there is a need for providing physical c onnectivity in \\nNagaland through quality roads for enabling faster movement of produ cts from villages \\nto the market. That meeting gave me a powerful message about the t ransformation which \\ncan take place to the 600,000 villages of India, if all the villages a re empowered to deal \\nwith their development and are well connected among themselves and wit h the urban \\nsocieties. \\n \\nMobilizing rural core competence for competitiveness \\nNow I would like to talk about the initiative of Periyar Maniammai  College of \\nTechnology for Women, Vallam, Tanjore of Providing Urban Amenities in Rural Areas \\n(PURA) complex involving 65 villages with a population of 3 lakhs. This inc ludes \\nprovision of three connectivities - physical, electronic and knowledge  - leading to \\neconomic connectivity. Periyar PURA has health care centers, pr imary to post graduate \\nlevel education and vocational training centers. This has resulted i n large-scale \\nemployment generation and creation of number of entrepreneurs with the  active support \\nof 1000 self-help groups. Two hundred acres of waste land has been develope d into a \\ncultivable land. The villagers are busy in cultivation, planting Jatropha, herbal and \\nmedicinal plants, power generation using bio-mass, food processing and above all \\nrunning marketing centers. It provides a sustainable economic development model for the \\nwhole region. \\n \\nDuring the last eight months, people of Periyar PURA villages technologically supported \\nby Periyar Maniammai College of Engineering for Women have w orked with experts \\nfrom Japan External Trade Organisation (JETRO) on various products, for  which core \\ncompetence and raw material are available in Thanjavur district. They developed \\ninternationally competitive prototypes for 55 life style products wi th support of JETRO \\nspecialists and feedback from exhibitions at Delhi and Tokyo. This co -operative venture \\nhas enhanced the innovative ability of the people of all the 65 villages  enabling them to \\ndevelop and produce internationally acceptable products. I have seen si milar type of \\nPURA being established in many states. The whole country needs 7000 PU RA to \\nbridging the rural – urban divide. \\n \\nSeed to Food: Backbone for agricultural growth'),\n",

Recently, during my address to the agricultural \\nscientists while participating in a National Symposium on “Agri culture Cannot Wait”, I \\nsummarized the many practical suggestions given by farmers. W e have to double the \\nagricultural production with reduced land, reduced water resources and re duced \\nmanpower and improve the economic conditions of the nation through the principle  of \\n“Seed to Food” since agriculture is the backbone of the nation.

His radiant face was revealing his happy state of mi nd. He introduced himself \\nas Vidwan Coimbatore SR Krishna Murthy. I greeted him and asked him  how this had \\nhappened. He smilingly said that it was from by birth. He thanked G od, his parents, \\nteachers and many others for giving him confidence, training and he lp. I asked him, what \\nI could do for him? He said, “I don’t need anything from you. I would like to sing in fr ont \\nof you”. I readily agreed. He sang melodiously the Saint Thyagraj a’s pancha ratna kriti \\nentharo mahanubavulu in Sriragam giving me a glimpse of his talent. I was quite touched. \\nWhat is the message? Despite being physically challenged, the latent talent of music \\ncould blossom in this \\nperson with his positive attitude and perseverance, encouraged by the pa rents, teachers, \\nacademics and rasikas. Now he wants to give, give and give his art to inspire others. Of \\ncourse, by his merit of music, in July 2007, he performed in the Rashtra pati Bhavan art \\ntheatre. \\n \\nOvercome the impact of disaster through partnership \\nI had the opportunity to experience the Indomitable Spirit of the people  and children of \\nJammu & Kashmir even as they were just recovering from the de vastating earthquake in \\n2005. I visited Urusa village on 26th November 2005 which has been adopted by the  \\nWestern Air Command, Air Force for providing relief and medical aid to the residents of \\nthat area. When I went there, I found that the school building had been severely damaged. \\nI met all the school children and the village citizen of Urusa. The villagers apprised me of \\ntheir losses and had all praise for Army and Air Force role in rescue and relief operations \\nalong with state government.

These messages reflect his vision for India\\'s growth and progress during his tenure as President.\\n\\nDuring his five-year tenure, Kalam emphasized the importance of:\\n\\n1. Accelerating development driven by the aspirations of the youth, who are eager to live in a developed India by 2020, with over 15 lakh youth echoing the desire to live in a prosperous, safe, and proud India.\\n2. Empowering villages, as seen in his visit to Nagaland, where he witnessed the positive impact of an empowered village council functioning with financial powers and taking decisions, and his support for the development of Periyar PURA complexes in Tamil Nadu, which provides urban amenities to 65 villages, leading to economic connectivity, employment generation, and creation of 1000 entrepreneurs through active support of self-help groups.\\n3. Mobilizing rural core competence for competitiveness, as demonstrated by the Periyar PURA complex, which has been replicated in various states, and the nation requires 7000 similar PURA complexes to bridge the rural-urban divide.\\n4. Focusing on agriculture from seed to food production, as evident from the development of a sustainable agricultural model that has transformed the Periyar PURA villages, and his interactions with over 6000 farmers from different states and union territories, where he emphasized the need to double agricultural production with reduced land, water resources, and manpower, promoting the principle of \"Seed to Food\" as a backbone of the nation\\'s economy.\\n5. Overcoming problems through partnership, as seen in the co-operative venture between the villagers and experts from Japan External Trade Organisation (JETRO), which enabled the development of internationally competitive prototypes for 55 lifestyle products, and the Pan African e-Network project, which aims to connect 53 African countries with seamless and integrated satellite, fiber optics, and wireless network.\\n6. Displaying courage in combatting calamities, as evident from his visit to Urusa village in Jammu & Kashmir after the devastating earthquake in 2005, and his interactions with the tribal council leaders, students, and children of Chuckchucha village in the Car Nicobar Islands, who showed remarkable courage and resilience in the face of the 2004 tsunami.\\n7. Enhancing connectivity for societal transformation, as reflected in his emphasis on bridging the rural-urban divide through the establishment of PURA complexes, and his support for the Pan African e-Network project, which aims to connect 53 African countries, and his address to the Pan African Parliament in 2004, where he highlighted the importance of connectivity for societal transformation.\\n8. Defending the nation with pride, as demonstrated by his strong support for the country\\'s military and defense forces, particularly through his visits to the Siachen Glacier, INS Sindhurakshak, and experiencing a Sukhoi-30 fighter, which showcased the bravery and commitment of the Indian Armed Forces.\\n9. Fostering a youth movement for a developed India by 2020, with over 15 lakh youth echoing the desire to live in a prosperous, safe, and proud India, and supporting the development of the Pan African e-Network project, which aims to provide education and healthcare to African countries through tele-education and tele-medicine centers.\\n10. Listening and working towards realizing the dreams of the youth, as evident from his willingness to support and take their ideas to the highest institution of the nation, and his interactions with the Lead India 2020 Foundation in Hyderabad, which aims to transform youth into enlightened citizens.\\n\\nIn addition to these key messages, Kalam emphasizes the importance of preserving India\\'s rich cultural heritage and civilization for future generations, as he envisions a developed India by 2020 as \"a nation that is one of the best places to live in and is proud of its leadership.\" He believes that this can be achieved through countrywide participation of multiple institutions, and that the power of the 540 million youth of the country can be harnessed to drive this effort.\\n\\nKalam\\'s vision for India\\'s development also emphasizes the importance of empowering the youth through value-based education and leadership, and believes that the 540 million youth below the age of 25 have the potential to be the most powerful resource for the nation. He envisions a developed India by 2020, where the rural and urban divide has reduced to a thin line, there is an equitable distribution and adequate access to energy and quality water, agriculture, industry, and service sector work together in harmony, education is accessible to all, and the nation is a best destination for the most talented scholars, scientists, and investors.\\n\\nFurthermore, Kalam\\'s vision for India\\'s development includes:\\n\\n* Creating a nation where the best of healthcare is available to all\\n* Achieving a responsive, transparent, and corruption-free governance system\\n* Eradicating poverty and illiteracy, and eliminating crimes against women and children\\n* Building a prosperous, healthy, secure, peaceful, and happy nation, with a sustainable growth path\\n\\nOverall, A P J Abdul Kalam\\'s vision for India\\'s development is one of empowerment, partnership, and resilience. He emphasizes the importance of supporting the youth, villages, and farmers in their pursuit of a developed India, and encourages the nation to overcome problems through courage and determination, while also promoting international cooperation and partnerships to drive development and progress.\\n\\nIn his concluding speech, Kalam shares his mission in life, which is to bring connectivity between billion hearts and minds of the people of India in our multicultural society and to embed the self-confidence that \"we can do it\". He encourages the nation to work together in the great mission of making India a developed nation before 2020, and concludes with a message of hope and determination, wishing the nation God\\'s blessings and saying \"Jai Hind\".'"
